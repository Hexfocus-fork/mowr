        <dt>What is this?</dt>
        <dd>MOWR is a virustotal-like web application aiming at helping to detect malicious web files. It uses
            <a href="https://github.com/nbs-system/php-malware-finder">PMF</a> to detect the samples as malicious or
            not.
            To use it simply drag and drop a file in the drop zone or click it to browse your computer. Then MOWR will
            automatically download your file and scan it.

        <dt>File analysis</dt>
        <dd>Before selecting your file, make sure you selected the correct analysis type (PHP or ASP).
            Then, drag and drop it on the dropzone or click it to browse your file system and choose a file to upload.

        <dt>Search field</dt>
        <dd>
            You can <a href="{{ url_for('default.search_page') }}">search</a> for a file specifying its name or its
            sha256.
            You can make more precise searches using the prefix system.
            For instance you can do `name:php` and it will get you all the files containing php in their names.
            You can also search for a <a href="#tags">tag</a> like this `tag:Scanner`. Be careful, the tag name is case
            sensitive.
            Of course you can use multiple filters like so: `name:php tag:Scanner`.

        <dt id="tags">Tags</dt>
        <dd>
            You can set a tag to a file from a pre-determined list. Then using this tags you can search for any sample
            we
            already scanned and view its information.

        <dt>Malicious ratio</dt>
        <dd>
            After uploading a file, you have the possibility to declare a sample as 'clean' or 'malicious'. This can
            help
            other
            people to have users feedback from a specific sample.
